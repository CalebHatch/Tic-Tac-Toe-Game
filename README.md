# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Written by: Caleb Hatch

## What is this program?

This program allows two players to play a game of tic-tac-toe against each other. The board is laid out with numbers filling the potential blank spaces that the user can change. Entering the corresponding number will change that number to an "X" or "O" depending on the player that entered the number. Standard tic-tac-toe rules apply. The first user to align their "X"'s or "O"'s respectively in a 3 letter long line wins. Have fun!
